    <!-- Tool Overview -->
    <section class="content-section fade-in">
      <h2><span class="gradient-text">Tool Overview</span></h2>
      <p><strong>Claude Code</strong> is an AI coding assistant that works in the terminal. You describe what you want in plain language, and it can plan the work, create and edit files, run commands, and improve the result based on what happens.</p>
      <p>Instead of just suggesting code for you to copy and paste, it can do the work directly in your project: update files, run <code>git</code> commands, and publish changes.</p>
      <p>For this project, Claude Code handled the full build: creating files, styling the page, adding interactivity, running git steps, and deploying to GitHub Pages. The human set direction and approved actions along the way.</p>

    <!-- Prompting Approach -->
    <section class="content-section fade-in">
      <h2>The <span class="gradient-text">Prompting Approach</span></h2>
      <p>Getting a polished result from an AI coding assistant is less about one "perfect" prompt and more about guiding the conversation clearly. Here's the strategy that worked:</p>

      <h3>1. Start with the big picture</h3>
      <p>The first prompt explained the goal at a high level: "Create a polished demo landing page to showcase Claude Code's capabilities." That gave the AI room to ask clarifying questions instead of guessing.</p>

      <h3>2. Make decisions upfront</h3>
      <p>Before writing code, the key decisions were set: technology (plain HTML/CSS/JS), visual style (dark modern), sections to include, and hosting (GitHub Pages). This avoided time-consuming changes later.</p>

      <h3>3. Provide a structured plan</h3>
      <p>Instead of vague instructions, the work was mapped as a simple step-by-step list — create the repo, build each file, deploy. This gave the AI clear checkpoints and kept it focused.</p>

      <h3>4. Let the AI handle details</h3>
      <p>The plan defined <em>what</em> each section should include, without prescribing every exact detail. Giving the AI room to choose spacing, colors, and icons played to its strengths.</p>

      <h3>5. Iterate if needed</h3>
      <p>After the first version was ready, small refinements could be requested — "make the gradient more subtle" or "add space to the pricing cards." Each round was quick because the AI already had context.</p>

    <!-- Tech Stack Decisions -->
    <section class="content-section fade-in">
      <h2>Tech Stack <span class="gradient-text">Decisions</span></h2>
      <p>Every choice was made to get from idea to live website quickly. Here's why:</p>

      <h3>HTML/CSS/JS vs. React/Frameworks</h3>
      <div class="pros-cons">
        <div class="pro">
          <strong>Pros</strong>
          <p>No build setup needed. No <code>npm install</code>, no bundler configuration, no compile wait time. The files work immediately, and GitHub Pages can host them directly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="con">
          <strong>Cons</strong>
          <p>Less built-in convenience — for example, the navigation is duplicated across pages, responsive behavior is manual, and there are fewer developer shortcuts.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Why chosen:</strong> For a two-page demo site, framework setup would likely take longer than any time it saved. Plain HTML/CSS/JS was the quickest route from zero to deployed.</p>

      <h3>Dark Modern vs. Light/Colorful</h3>
      <div class="pros-cons">
        <div class="pro">
          <strong>Pros</strong>
          <p>Strong visual impact. Gradient accents stand out on dark backgrounds. The look feels modern and premium.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="con">
          <strong>Cons</strong>
          <p>Accessibility needs extra attention, especially color contrast. Some people prefer light themes. Dark-on-dark details can look unclear if not tuned carefully.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Why chosen:</strong> This is a portfolio/speed demo, not a production app. The dark modern style created the strongest first impression for the intended audience.</p>

      <h3>GitHub Pages vs. Other Hosting</h3>
      <div class="pros-cons">
        <div class="pro">
          <strong>Pros</strong>
          <p>Free and simple. Push to <code>main</code>, enable Pages, and the site is live. It works naturally with the repo and supports custom domains later if needed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="con">
          <strong>Cons</strong>
          <p>Best for static sites only (no server-side logic or API routes). Build options are more limited than some other platforms.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Why chosen:</strong> Because this site is fully static, GitHub Pages was the fastest path from <code>git push</code> to a live URL.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Why No Extra Tooling -->
    <section class="content-section fade-in">
      <h2>Why <span class="gradient-text">No Extra Tooling</span></h2>
      <p>This project was built entirely with Claude Code's built-in features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>File Write/Edit</strong> — to create and modify HTML, CSS, and JS files</li>
        <li><strong>Bash</strong> — to run <code>git</code> and <code>gh</code> CLI commands for repo creation and deployment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>No MCP servers, no external skill packs, no browser automation, and no separate design tools. Why?</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Setup time slows things down.</strong> Configuring extra systems takes time, which works against a speed demo.</li>
        <li><strong>Plain HTML/CSS/JS doesn't require build tooling.</strong> Nothing needs to be compiled or bundled, so files run as-is.</li>
        <li><strong>The constraint makes the point.</strong> If a polished landing page can be built and deployed with basic file editing and shell commands, the tool is capable of serious work.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Timeline -->
    <section class="content-section fade-in">
      <h2>The <span class="gradient-text">Timeline</span></h2>
      <p>From the first prompt to a live site on GitHub Pages:</p>
      <div class="timeline-badge">One conversation. Minutes, not hours.</div>
      <p>The process looked like this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Plan the approach and make key decisions (tech, style, structure)</li>
        <li>Create the GitHub repository</li>
        <li>Build all four files (index.html, styles.css, script.js, how-it-was-made.html)</li>
        <li>Commit, push, and enable GitHub Pages</li>
        <li>Verify the live site</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Where possible, the AI handled independent tasks in parallel (for example, creating separate files at the same time). The human provided the plan and approved each step. The result is what you're viewing now.</p>
