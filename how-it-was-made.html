    <!-- Tool Overview -->
    <section class="content-section fade-in">
      <h2><span class="gradient-text">Tool Overview</span></h2>
      <p><strong>Claude Code</strong> is an agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal. You give it a task in natural language, and it plans, writes, edits, and executes code — using your real filesystem, running real shell commands, and iterating based on results.</p>
      <p>It doesn't generate code in a chat bubble for you to copy-paste. It directly creates files, edits them in place, runs <code>git</code> commands, and deploys — acting as a collaborator that happens to operate at the speed of an LLM.</p>
      <p>For this project, Claude Code handled everything: file creation, CSS styling, JavaScript logic, git operations, and GitHub Pages deployment. The human's role was to provide the plan and approve actions along the way.</p>

    <!-- Prompting Approach -->
    <section class="content-section fade-in">
      <h2>The <span class="gradient-text">Prompting Approach</span></h2>
      <p>Getting a polished result from an AI coding tool isn't about writing one perfect prompt — it's about structuring the conversation. Here's the general strategy that worked:</p>

      <h3>1. Start with the big picture</h3>
      <p>The first prompt described the goal at a high level: "Create a polished demo landing page to showcase Claude Code's capabilities." This let the AI ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions.</p>

      <h3>2. Make decisions upfront</h3>
      <p>Before writing any code, key decisions were locked in: tech stack (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS), visual style (dark modern), sections to include, and hosting (GitHub Pages). This prevented mid-stream pivots that waste time.</p>

      <h3>3. Provide a structured plan</h3>
      <p>Rather than vague instructions, the implementation was laid out as a numbered list of concrete steps — create repo, build each file, deploy. This gives the AI clear checkpoints and prevents it from trying to do everything at once.</p>

      <h3>4. Let the AI handle details</h3>
      <p>The plan specified <em>what</em> each section should contain but didn't dictate exact HTML or pixel-perfect CSS. Giving the AI room to make implementation decisions (color values, spacing, SVG icons) plays to its strengths.</p>

      <h3>5. Iterate if needed</h3>
      <p>After the initial build, you can review and refine — "make the gradient more subtle," "add more spacing to the pricing cards," etc. Each iteration is fast because the AI has full context.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Tech Stack Decisions -->
    <section class="content-section fade-in">
      <h2>Tech Stack <span class="gradient-text">Decisions</span></h2>
      <p>Every choice was made to optimize for speed-to-live-site. Here's the reasoning:</p>

      <h3>HTML/CSS/JS vs. React/Frameworks</h3>
      <div class="pros-cons">
        <div class="pro">
          <strong>Pros</strong>
          <p>Zero build step. No <code>npm install</code>, no bundler config, no waiting for compilation. Files work the moment they exist. GitHub Pages serves them directly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="con">
          <strong>Cons</strong>
          <p>No component reuse — the nav is duplicated across pages. No hot module replacement during development. Manual responsive styling.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Why chosen:</strong> For a two-page demo site, the overhead of a framework (setup, dependencies, build pipeline) would take longer than the time it saves. Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS is the fastest path from zero to deployed.</p>

      <h3>Dark Modern vs. Light/Colorful</h3>
      <div class="pros-cons">
        <div class="pro">
          <strong>Pros</strong>
          <p>High visual impact. Gradient accents pop against dark backgrounds. Matches the aesthetic of tools developers already respect (Linear, Vercel, Raycast). Feels premium.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="con">
          <strong>Cons</strong>
          <p>Accessibility requires more care — contrast ratios need verification. Some users prefer light themes. Dark-on-dark borders can look muddy if not tuned.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Why chosen:</strong> This page is a portfolio piece / speed test, not a production app. The dark modern aesthetic creates the strongest first impression for a developer audience and is what people expect from a "cutting-edge" tool demo.</p>

      <h3>GitHub Pages vs. Other Hosting</h3>
      <div class="pros-cons">
        <div class="pro">
          <strong>Pros</strong>
          <p>Free. Zero configuration — just push to <code>main</code> and enable Pages. Tightly integrated with the repo. Custom domain support if needed later.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="con">
          <strong>Cons</strong>
          <p>Static files only (no server-side logic, no API routes). Build pipeline options are limited. CDN is decent but not as fast as Vercel/Cloudflare.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Why chosen:</strong> Since this is a static site with no backend, GitHub Pages is the fastest path from <code>git push</code> to live URL. Literally one API call to enable it.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Why No Extra Tooling -->
    <section class="content-section fade-in">
      <h2>Why <span class="gradient-text">No Extra Tooling</span></h2>
      <p>This project was built entirely with Claude Code's built-in capabilities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>File Write/Edit</strong> — to create and modify HTML, CSS, and JS files</li>
        <li><strong>Bash</strong> — to run <code>git</code> and <code>gh</code> CLI commands for repo creation and deployment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>No MCP servers, no external skill packs, no browser automation, no design tools. Why?</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Setup time kills speed.</strong> Configuring an MCP server or installing a skill pack takes minutes that defeat the purpose of a speed demo.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS doesn't need build tooling.</strong> There's nothing to compile, transpile, or bundle. The files work as-is.</li>
        <li><strong>The constraint proves the point.</strong> If you can build a polished, deployed landing page with just file editing and shell commands, the tool is powerful enough for serious work.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Timeline -->
    <section class="content-section fade-in">
      <h2>The <span class="gradient-text">Timeline</span></h2>
      <p>From the first prompt to a live, deployed site on GitHub Pages:</p>
      <div class="timeline-badge">One conversation. Minutes, not hours.</div>
      <p>The process looked like this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Plan the approach and make key decisions (tech, style, structure)</li>
        <li>Create the GitHub repository</li>
        <li>Build all four files (index.html, styles.css, script.js, how-it-was-made.html)</li>
        <li>Commit, push, and enable GitHub Pages</li>
        <li>Verify the live site</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The AI parallelized where possible — creating independent files simultaneously rather than sequentially. The human provided the plan and approved each step. The result is what you're looking at right now.</p>
